Data categorization

Write a program to categorize the data without destroying their original sequence.
Eg: Consider a group of numbers. Group the numbers maintaining their original order in each group.
3 22 12 6 10 34 65 29 9 30 81 4 5 19 20 57 44 99
categorize these nos in to 4 groups:
Group 1: < 10
Group 2: >10 and < 19
Group 3: >19 < 29
group 4: >29
Hint: Create multiple queues.

recurssion
Design a menu driven program by defining recursive functions to perform the following: and submit to lab classroom
1. To find factorial of a number
2. To find the nth fibonacci number
3. To find the smallest element in an array of N elements
4. To find the product of all the elements in an array of N elements
5. To solve Tower of Hanoi problem
